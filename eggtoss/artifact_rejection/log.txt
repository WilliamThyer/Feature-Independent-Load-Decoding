synchronize(): I detected 16 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 66

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 33 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 144

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 199 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 974

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 199 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 992

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 229 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 985

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 15

Synchronization quality:
Warning: For 966 of 981 EEG events (98.5%), no ET event of same name was found within plusminus 4 samples
This can occur, for example if some events were not transmitted to the ET (or EEG)
If only a few events do not have a "partner" event, and sync quality for the remaining events is good, you are probably safe.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
For the remaining 15 events, it is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 229 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1000

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 8

Synchronization quality:
Warning: For 562 of 570 EEG events (98.6%), no ET event of same name was found within plusminus 4 samples
This can occur, for example if some events were not transmitted to the ET (or EEG)
If only a few events do not have a "partner" event, and sync quality for the remaining events is good, you are probably safe.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
For the remaining 8 events, it is distributed as follows:

Warning: For 963 of 970 EEG events (99.3%), no ET event of same name was found within plusminus 4 samples
This can occur, for example if some events were not transmitted to the ET (or EEG)
If only a few events do not have a "partner" event, and sync quality for the remaining events is good, you are probably safe.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
For the remaining 7 events, it is distributed as follows:

-------------------------
    -4     0
    -3     1

synchronize(): I detected 234 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1089

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 205 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1010

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 991

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 199 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 988

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

   ([*] taking EEG as master clock & assuming the ET recording was never paused)
-- Eye track will be downsampled to match the EEG sampling rate

-- Note: the toolbox does not yet implement a low-pass filter to prevent aliasing.


synchronize(): I detected 199 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 595

Synchronization quality:
Warning: For 379 of 974 EEG events (38.9%), no ET event of same name was found within plusminus 4 samples
This can occur, for example if some events were not transmitted to the ET (or EEG)
If only a few events do not have a "partner" event, and sync quality for the remaining events is good, you are probably safe.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
For the remaining 595 events, it is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 199 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 984

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 229 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 994

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

Synchronization quality:
Warning: For 379 of 974 EEG events (38.9%), no ET event of same name was found within plusminus 4 samples
This can occur, for example if some events were not transmitted to the ET (or EEG)
If only a few events do not have a "partner" event, and sync quality for the remaining events is good, you are probably safe.

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.

Synchronization quality:
Warning: For 1002 of 1009 EEG events (99.3%), no ET event of same name was found within plusminus 4 samples
This can occur, for example if some events were not transmitted to the ET (or EEG)
If only a few events do not have a "partner" event, and sync quality for the remaining events is good, you are probably safe.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.

synchronize(): I detected 214 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1027

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

Warning: For 957 of 966 EEG events (99.1%), no ET event of same name was found within plusminus 4 samples
This can occur, for example if some events were not transmitted to the ET (or EEG)
If only a few events do not have a "partner" event, and sync quality for the remaining events is good, you are probably safe.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
For the remaining 9 events, it is distributed as follows:

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 376

Synchronization quality:
Warning: For 712 of 1088 EEG events (65.4%), no ET event of same name was found within plusminus 4 samples
This can occur, for example if some events were not transmitted to the ET (or EEG)
If only a few events do not have a "partner" event, and sync quality for the remaining events is good, you are probably safe.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
For the remaining 376 events, it is distributed as follows:

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 980

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 199 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 992

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 59 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 323

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 227 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1358

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

   ([*] taking EEG as master clock & assuming the ET recording was never paused)
-- Eye track will be downsampled to match the EEG sampling rate

-- Note: the toolbox does not yet implement a low-pass filter to prevent aliasing.


synchronize(): I detected 227 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1364

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 227 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1132

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 227 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1127

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

-- 500.00 Hz EEG sampling rate
-- 720.16 Hz estimated ET sampling rate [*]
   ([*] taking EEG as master clock & assuming the ET recording was never paused)
-- Eye track will be downsampled to match the EEG sampling rate

-- Note: the toolbox does not yet implement a low-pass filter to prevent aliasing.


synchronize(): I detected 227 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1140

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 280 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1158

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 235 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1162

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 235 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1166

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 280 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1126

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 266 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1216

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

synchronize(): I detected 235 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1079

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

Error [smp]	Events
-------------------------
    -4     0
    -3     0
    -2     0
    -1    15
     0   543
     1    66
     2     0
     3     0
     4     0

-------------------------
Mean abs. sync. error (estimated from "shared" events): 0.260 ms

-- 561119 EEG samples in synchronization range
-- 684699 ET samples in synchronization range
-- 500.00 Hz EEG sampling rate
-- 610.12 Hz estimated ET sampling rate [*]
   ([*] taking EEG as master clock & assuming the ET recording was never paused)
-- Eye track will be downsampled to match the EEG sampling rate

-- Note: the toolbox does not yet implement a low-pass filter to prevent aliasing.


synchronize(): I detected 235 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 1154
