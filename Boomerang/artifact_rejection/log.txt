Warning: For 6061 of 6127 EEG events (98.9%), no ET event of same name was found within plusminus 5 samples
Possibly, some events were not transmitted to the eye tracker?
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
For the remaining 66 events, it is distributed as follows:

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 5098

Synchronization quality:
Warning: For 1040 of 6138 EEG events (16.9%), no ET event of same name was found within plusminus 4 samples
This can occur, for example if some events were not transmitted to the ET (or EEG)
If only a few events do not have a "partner" event, and sync quality for the remaining events is good, you are probably safe.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
For the remaining 5098 events, it is distributed as follows:

-- 3640717 EEG samples in synchronization range
-- 3679050 ET samples in synchronization range
-- 500.00 Hz EEG sampling rate
-- 505.26 Hz estimated ET sampling rate [*]
   ([*] taking EEG as master clock & assuming the ET recording was never paused)
-- Eye track will be downsampled to match the EEG sampling rate

-- Note: the toolbox does not yet implement a low-pass filter to prevent aliasing.


synchronize(): I detected 1523 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 6615

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

pop_importeyetracker(): Synchronizing EEG and eye tracking data...

-- 2434422 EEG samples in synchronization range
-- 2801137 ET samples in synchronization range
-- 500.00 Hz EEG sampling rate
-- 575.32 Hz estimated ET sampling rate [*]
   ([*] taking EEG as master clock & assuming the ET recording was never paused)
-- Eye track will be downsampled to match the EEG sampling rate

-- Note: the toolbox does not yet implement a low-pass filter to prevent aliasing.


synchronize(): I detected 1223 PAUSES in the eye-tracking recording!
Pauses were defined as jumps in the ET time stamp > 3 samples
The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 5978

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

The last data sample before and first sample after each pause
will be set to zero to avoid interpolation artifacts during the pause!

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 6001

Synchronization quality:
For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
It is distributed as follows:

Shared events of same type less than +/- 4 samples apart: 56

Synchronization quality:
Warning: For 6071 of 6127 EEG events (99.1%), no ET event of same name was found within plusminus 4 samples
This can occur, for example if some events were not transmitted to the ET (or EEG)
If only a few events do not have a "partner" event, and sync quality for the remaining events is good, you are probably safe.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
For the remaining 56 events, it is distributed as follows:

For all events in the EEG, an ET event of the same type was found within plusminus 4 samples.
Synch. error is the latency difference between matching ET/EEG events after synchronization.
